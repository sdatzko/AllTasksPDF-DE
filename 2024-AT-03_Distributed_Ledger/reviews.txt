The process of "cheating" is not clearly defined and asumes that students will supose that a record that appears in a minority of servers must be considered cheating. For the example case this asumption may be true for the majority of students, but a lot of other cases more ambiguous can be thinked of and this penalizes the analytical student over one that only goes for the obvious option in the example instance. The task may be improved if the process of cheating is stated more clearly, but I believe this would make the problem easier.

[TiCT] The CT seccion is missing
