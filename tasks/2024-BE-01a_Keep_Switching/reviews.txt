Nice introduction to sorting. Didn't find anything to improve.

[AGE] this task is harder than indicated
[IDEA] I like the simpleness of the "setting" of the task. But this task can become a real timekiller if someone doesn't understand what is happening. I think this is only possible to do with a MC option.
[TEXT] The steps are understandable and with a short description. Very nicely done! 
[EXPL] Probably show the first steps to go from the unsorted to the sorted list.
[TiI] very good
[TiCT] well done.
[GRAPH] very nice Kris! I like your simple design, but if you would like to have some beaver Gartenzwerge I could do this for you ;)

[AGE] Ok
[IDEA] Nice! It would be good to contextualize the task in some narrative that is attractive for students to read (a board game, for example).
[TEXT] Ok
[EXPL] Ok. Complementing the explanation with some image would be nice.
[TiI] Ok
[TiCT] Ok
[GRAPH] OK

[AGE] I feel that this task is harder than suggested.
[IDEA] Ok
[TEXT] The task is well described, good text.
[EXPL] It would be nice to have pictures showing the process in answer explanation.
[TiI] Ok
[TiCT] This is computatoinal thinking section is not as nice as TiI. 
[GRAPH] It is a bit hard to count the number of the white counters. If the outlines were a bit darker, it might help. Then again, the height difference is quite clear and there is no need to counting.
