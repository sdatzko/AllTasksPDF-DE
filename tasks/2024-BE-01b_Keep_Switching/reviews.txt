[AGE] I suggest that it is enough to indicate "medium" for 12yo–14yo - other levels are clear. 
[IDEA] Interesting idea and modelling of situation.
[TEXT] Very good and clear formulation.
[EXPL] Excellent explanation! 
[TiI] Good enough. Can be a bit more expanded and explained for 12oy-14oy students.
[TiCT] not provided 
[GRAPH] good enough, the colours could be brighter to make the heights of the stacks more visible
[AUTH] fine
[NAME] ok

[AGE] The task seems harder than indicated? I would rate it as at least medium for 14 - 19 yo.
[IDEA] The task is a nice rephrasing of a classic sorting task.
[TEXT] I don't like how the rules (seemingly on purpose, as the issue is mentioned in TiI) allow moving the black counter out from the left end of the board without specifying what happens next. It might confuse a student even though the particular configurations used in the task will not lead into such a move.
[EXPL] A clear and comprehensive explanation.
[TiI] The section is otherwise fine, but mentioning "quick sort" and "merge sort" without any links to further information seemed odd. Students probably have no knowledge about those sorting algorithms.
[TiCT] The section is present and perhaps ok. I am not sure how to rate the TiCT section...
[GRAPH] Pictures are ok.
[AUTH] Ok.
[NAME] Ok.

[AGE] Is the age/difficulty level specified? Is it appropriate for the task and question?
Ok, maybe medium for 14-16 yo as well because it takes some time to read and understand the problem.
[IDEA] Is the idea original and attractive? Does it require some computational thinking skill to be understood and solved?
It feels a bit too algorithmic and more computing and following steps without mistake than actual problem solving.
[TEXT] Is the text of the task clear and understandable by students of the appropriate level, without CS pre-knowledge? Are words and expressions used consistently in the text and question?
Yes.
[EXPL] Is the “Answer Explanation” section available and complete? Is it understandable by students of the appropriate level? Is there a clear reason why the correct answer is correct? Is there a clear reason why the wrong answers are wrong?
Yes.
[TiI] Is the “It’s informatics” section available? Is it understandable by students of the appropriate level? Is it well connected to the task? Does it describe the background of the "story", the connection to the informatics (computer science) of this task?
Yes.
[TiCT] If the “This is Computational Thinking” section is available: does it describe the solving process, what skills do we need used to solve the task? (this is optional for this year, so don't rate your task based whether this section is filled out or not)
Yes.
[GRAPH] Are the figures clear and appealing? Are they suitable for the age group (not too many beavers for older students!). Are they CC-licensed and may be re-used and modified? Are they available in SVG format (i.e., as vector graphics)?
They are ok, a bit more contrast the piece boarders might help.
[AUTH] Are the name(s) and mail address(es) of the author(s) available?
Yes.
[NAME] Do the names of the task folder and file(s) comply with the prescribed format?
Yes.
[OTHER] Is there anything else that can be useful for the author or the community?
No.

[AGE] hard 12yo – 14yo, medium 14yo – 16yo, hard 16yo -19yo 

[IDEA] A good way to cover aspects of sorting. 

[TEXT] Text is clear. However, I would prefer to see the clarification included in step 1 for what happens if the left pile is taller -- even though I know it doesn't happen with the specific inputs in the task, because it may cause a bright child to waste precious minutes thinking about it. How about the addition of just two words in step 1: "... move the black counter one cell to the left, <<if possible>>"?

[EXPL] The explanation is well done, including the short-cut required to find the answer efficiently.

[TiL] Good 

[TiCT] Good. Evaluation present here as well as we can examine if doing every move is the quickest way rather than comparing the progress of moves to each other. 

[GRAPH] good graphics with good reasoning to avoid making students aware that this is a gnome sort problem. Individual graphic files not listed. I would make the stacks of coins higher contrast so it is easier to count the number of them.

[AUTH] good 

[NAME] good
