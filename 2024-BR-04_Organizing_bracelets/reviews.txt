This task crashed my LibreOffice repeatedly. When I did manage to get it open, all the bracelet images appeared the same (solid black beads). I think there is an issue with the images, but I think I understand what the task is intended to be.

Are the patterns all meant to be in grayscale? Or is that a problem with my LibreOffice rendering?  As I am seeing it, the grayscale patterns are not different enough from each other. More points of difference between the patterns (such as colours or different shapes) would really help.

I personally find pattern matching to be a weak Informatics connection although I accept it as a computational thinking skill. I also accept that this type of task can work well for younger students.

I love this task. This problem gives to me a variety of imaginations in pattern matching. However, the Reason for the correct answer needs to be clearer.
